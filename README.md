# FoodTrucker - Backend

## Description

This repository contains the backend code for FoodTrucker, a platform that helps you find food trucks in your neighborhood and the upcoming events where you can catch them. The backend is built using Express, serving as the API that handles server-side logic and communicates with the database. The frontend code interacts with this API to provide a seamless user experience. The frontend code can be found in the [frontend repository](https://github.com/react-P3/foodTrucker-client).
